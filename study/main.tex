    \begin{enumerate}

    % \item 24/7~carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement leads to lower emissions for both the buyer and the system,

\section{Introduction}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  \centering
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Climate change is driving a global effort to rapidly decarbonise 
    electricity systems across the globe. 
    Many public and private energy buyers have joined this effort 
    by purchasing certificates for renewable energy or
    by procuring renewable energy directly with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
    \item Such \alert{voluntary commitments accelerate the deployment of renewable 
    capacity} above the policy requirements in the countries and jurisdictions
    where these companies operate, facilitating faster
    transformation of electricity markets.
    \item Additionally, many early actors in the field have paved the way for others to follow 
    \hrefc{https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/247-carbon-free-energy.pdf}{by 
    developing methods and establishing standard contracts} for clean energy procurement.
    \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{6cm}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item   PPAs typically are typically used for renewable energy to match generation 
        and consumption on average over a year.
        \item For example, more than 370 members of the \href{https://www.there100.org/}{RE100} group have committed to purchasing enough renewable energy to match
        \alert{100\% of their electricity consumption on an annual basis}.

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  
    \begin{itemize}
    \item However, electricity buyers that commit to 100\% annual matching 
    from renewable energy sources still face times when generation 
    from wind and solar generators is not sufficient to match 
    the companies’ electricity demand. 
    \item Thus, although buyers match their demand on a \alert{yearly} basis with 
    renewable energy, on an \alert{hourly} basis they still have hours 
    when they have to rely on carbon-emitting technologies available 
    on the local market, such as coal and gas-fired power plants.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  
  More generally, 100\% annual matching leads to many challenges 
  from the electricity buyers' and system perspectives: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No \alert{simultaneity} - variable generation of wind and solar power is not aligned with the 
  buyers' electricity consumption profile.
  \item Lack of \alert{additionality} - some buyers procure unbundled guarantees of origin from existing 
  facilities, which does not lead to additional renewable generation.
  \item Displaced \alert{location} - some buyers procure PPAs from locations far away 
  from their consumption, where there is no way to transmit the electricity to the demand.
  \item Exposure to \alert{risk} - electricity buyers are exposed to price volatility 
  in local electricity markets, since they still have to procure electricity to cover
  the difference between demand and supply.
  \item Need for \alert{backup} - the rest of the electricity system still has to 
  maintain backup and flexibility options for hours with low renewable generation.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{24/7 carbon-free energy}

  \centering

  There is growing interest from leaders in voluntary clean
  electricity procurement to cover their consumption 
  with clean energy supply on a \alert{truly 24/7 basis}. \\
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met
  with carbon-free electricity sources, \alert{every hour of every day}.
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Yearly versus hourly matching}
  
  24/7 CFE procurement has potential benefits over the 100\% renewable matching:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ensure match of electricity consumption with carbon-free resources 
        on an \alert{hourly basis}.
  \item Enable much \alert{deeper reductions in CO$_2$ emissions} associated 
        to buyer's electricity consumption.
  \item Ensure that contracted power is \alert{additional} (i.e. leads to new capacity).
  \item Ensure that power comes from the \alert{same bidding zone}.
  \item Enable technology-neutral procurement of \alert{carbon-free} rather than renewable technologies 
        (such as advanced clean dispatchable power generation and long-duration energy storage).

\begin{frame}{Narrow down focus and outline motivation for our new study}

A growing interest from C\&I sector companies to pursue 24/7 CFE \\
A subset of C\&I, like data center operators, have the potential to use spatial and temporal flexibility to achieve high 24/7 CFE easier and help others \\
The first study on space and time load-shifting load management for flexible C\&I that pursue 24/7 carbon-free electricity procurement goals \\
However, in the previous study, we implicitly assumed \alert{inflexible demand} for C\&I consumers.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Focus of the study}

  In this study, we focus our analysis on \alert{space-time load-shifting} provided by flexible electricity consumers, such as data centers.
  Thus, in the context of this study, buyers committed to 24/7 CFE procurement can \\
  - shift loads across \alert{time} (via job scheduling); \\
  - shift loads across \alert{space} (via service migration); \\
  - both of the above, i.e., co-optimization of space-time flexibility.

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  We aim to answer the following quesitons:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To which extent can load-shifting flexibility reduce the \alert{means and costs} of hourly clean energy matching?\\ 
    \item Investigate \alert{individual effects} of space/time flexibility, as well as their \alert{interplay}.\\
    \item How the flexibility value varies across data center \alert{locations} and \alert{years}.\\
    \item ...

\section{Methodology}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A quick overview}

{\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The optimization model is based on \hrefc{https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur}{PyPSA-Eur} -- a widely-used open-source model of the European energy system.

    \item In this study, we build upon the mathematical model of 24/7 clean energy procurement
    developed in the former work of authors: \hrefc{https://zenodo.org/record/7180097}{System-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free electricity procurement in Europe} (October 2022)
    
    \item We encode a set of new equations and routines, which allow for incorporating spatial (service migration) and temporal (job scheduling) load management systems for data centers.

    \item The model optimises investment and operational decisions to meet projected
    electricity demand for the 24/7~CFE consumers, as well as the demand of other consumers in the European electricity system, while meeting all relevant engineering, reliability, and policy constraints. ...
    % \item We compare 100\% annual matching with renewable energy versus 
    % different targets for hourly CFE matching.

    % \item We place C\&I consumers committed to a clean energy procurement in a 
    % selection of European countries: Germany, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.
    % These countries differ in patterns of electricity demand, renewable potentials,
    % national energy and climate policies, legacy fleets of generation capacities, degree 
    % of interconnectons, etc. Apart form that, we consider different C\&I participation rates, a wide palette 
    % of CFE generation technologies available for 24/7 consumers, 
    % and two years (2025 and 2030). These differences help to understand and generalize 
    % the impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement.

\begin{frame}{Mathematical model of 24/7 CFE procurement}

  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The mathematical model of 24/7~CFE procurement is based on the former work of authors: \hrefc{https://zenodo.org/record/7180097}{System-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free electricity procurement in Europe} published in October 2022.

  \item The study included mathematics additional to the PyPSA-Eur model to encode a situation when a fraction of C\&I consumers in a selected European countries commit to the 24/7~CFE goals. The resulting problem optimized investment and operational decisions to meet projected electricity demand for the 24/7~CFE consumers, as well as the demand of other consumers in the European electricity system, while meeting all relevant engineering, reliability, and policy constraints.
  
  \item In this study, we enhance the mathematical model of 24/7~CFE procurement 
  by considering demand flexibility that can take form of \alert{temporal} (workloads scheduling) and \alert{spatial} (service migration) load management. 
  
  \item Thus, flexible participants such as data centers can meet their CFE targets by either procuring energy generation \& storage assets directly, and/or buying electricity from a local grid in hours when electricity mix is sufficiently clean  (like in the previous study), and utilizing spatial \& temporal flexibility \alert{to make [...]}.

\begin{frame}{Matching electricity supply and demand: a case of inflexible consumer}

  {\footnotesize
  The model optimizes a portfolio of carbon-free generation and storage technologies 
  procured by the C\&I consumers that commit to 24/7~CFE goals. The portfolio assets have to be located in the same market zone.

  The hourly demand of 24/7 participating consumer $d_t$ for hour $t$ can be met by a combination of the following: \\
    \begin{itemize}
      \item dispatch $g_{r,t}$ of procured carbon-free generators $r\in CFE$ 
      \item dispatch $\bar{g}_{s,t}$ of procured storage technologies $s\in STO$

  {\footnotesize

  The \alert{grid CFE factor} $CFE_t$ in eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}) defines the percentage of clean electricity in each MWh of imported electricity from the grid to supply participating 24/7 loads in a given hour. The factor depends on the generation mix in the region where 24/7 participant is located, as well as on the generation mix in other regions from which electricity is imported to the local region ($import_t$).

  \begin{columns}
    \begin{column}{8cm}
    Using notation on the right, the average cleanness of the rest of the electricity system is:   
  \begin{equation*}
  ImportCFE_t = \frac{A_t}{A_t + D_t}
  \end{equation*}

  The CFE factor of grid supply\footnote{\scriptsize{Generators contracted by 24/7 consumers (C) are excluded from the grid supply.}} for a given hour $t$ is:

  \begin{equation*}
  CFE_t = \frac{B_t + ImportCFE_t * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}

  Note that the grid CFE factor is affected by capacity procured by 24/7 consumers. This
  introduces a nonconvex term to the optimization problem. The nonconvexity can be avoided by treating the grid CFE factor as a parameter that is iteratively updated (starting with $CFE_t =0 \,~\forall t$). In the previous study, we concluded that one forward pass (i.e. 2 iterations) yields very good convergence. This observation holds true also for the optimization problem behind this study with multiple 24/7 consumers.}

\begin{frame}{24/7 CFE matching: excess CFE}

  {\footnotesize

  The \alert{excess CFE} represents generation from the procured resources above consumption of the 24/7 participant in a particular hour.  The excess CFE \alert{is not counted toward the CFE score} -- and thus it is subtracted on the left-hand side of the eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}). While it does not contribute to the CFE Score, excess CFE could potentially be stored (using batteries) and shifted to another hour, sold to the regional grid at {\bf market prices}, or curtailed. 

  \vspace{0.2cm}

  The total amount of CFE exported to the regional grid is constrained to a certain level on an annual basis. The export limit ($ExLimit$) is set to 20\% of annual 24/7 participating consumer's demand. 
  Thus, constraint (\ref{eqn:excess}) gives the 24/7 participant flexibility to sell electricity to the regional grid, while avoiding the situation that sales to the grid become significantly larger than CFE supply to own demand.
  
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{t\in T} export_t \leq ExLimit \cdot \sum_{t\in T} d_t

  \item The premise of data center flexibility is that a known amount of computing jobs, and assosiated power usage is "flexible", i.e., electricity loads can potentially be shifted in space (across datacenter locations), or to other times (by delaying jobs' execution).\footnote{{\scriptsize A change in cluster-level CPU usage can be accurately mapped into a change in its power usage, see \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11750}{Radovanovic et al. (2021)}}}

  We introduce a concept of \alert{spatial load management system} that allows for shifting workloads across locations. The load shifts take place via \alert{virtual links} -- non-physical pathways between data center nodes.

  Let $\Theta$ be the set of all virtual links; let $\delta_\vartheta \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ be load shifts (flows via virtual pathways); and let $N_{DC}$ be the set of data centers (flexible consumers). We can define $\Theta_n^{snd} := \{\vartheta \in \Theta | snd(\vartheta) = n\} \subseteq \Theta$, $\Theta_n^{rec} := \{\vartheta \in \Theta | rec(\vartheta) = n\} \subseteq \Theta$ to be the set of sending and receiving virtual links at node $n \in N_{DC}$.

  The nodal energy balance defined for inflexible consumers (eq. \ref{eqn:inflexnb}) is now extended by spatial load shifts, since the requested load at a given node can include shifts to/from other data center nodes: 
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{r\in CFE} g_{r,n,t} + \sum_{s\in STO} \left(\bar{g}_{s,n,t} - \ubar{g}_{s,n,t}\right) - ex_{n,t} + im_{n,t}  = \textcolor{TUred}{d_{n,t} + \sum_{\vartheta \in \Theta_n^{rec}}\delta_{\vartheta, t} - \sum_{\vartheta \in \Theta_n^{snd}}\delta_{\vartheta, t}} \hspace{.5cm} \forall n \in N_{DC}, t \in T

\begin{frame}{Temporal load shifting problem 1/2}

  {\footnotesize

  To capture temporal flexibility, we introduce a concept a data center \alert{temporal load management system} that allows for shifting load from a given time to another time point in the future.

  Consider a time horizon of our optimization problem $T = \{t_1 , t_2 , ..., t_T\}$. For simplicity, let us assume that there is a single flexible consumer (i.e., no spatial load shifts) with a demand-side temporal load management mechanism denoted with a singleton set $\{s'\}$.
  Let variables $\bar{g}_{s',t},\ubar{g}_{s',t} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ to be workloads that are resheduled in time, i.e., shifted from a time $t$ to a later time $t'$. Thus, the requested load  $\widetilde{d_{t}}$ of flexible consumer can deviate from the nominal value $d_{n,t}$ due to temporal load management. The nodal energy balance is now extended with the variables $\bar{g}_{s',t},\ubar{g}_{s',t}$ accordingly:
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{r\in CFE} g_{r,t} + \sum_{s\in STO} \left(\bar{g}_{s,t} - \ubar{g}_{s,t}\right) - ex_{t} + im_{t}  = \textcolor{TUred}{d_{t} + \sum_{{s'}} \left(\bar{g}_{s',t} - \ubar{g}_{s',t}\right)}\hspace{.5cm} \{N_{DC}\}, \forall t \in T

For countries w/o a 2025 target, a linear increase from renewable generation in 2020 to 2030 target is assumed.

\section{Modelling results and analysis}


%----------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Scenario space}

  {\small
  The following section presents modelling results and related analysis. 
  For convenience, we start with a \alert{base scenario} 
  with the following setup:

    \quad{\bf Zone:} IE | DE | DK1 | NL \\
    \quad{\bf Technology palette:} 1 | 2 | 3 \\
    \quad{\bf Year:} 2025 \\ 
    \quad{\bf Participation rate:} 10\% of C\&I demand in a modelled zone \\
    \quad{\bf Demand profile}: baseload (flat) \\
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Afterwards, we explore the scenario space further by implementing one-at-a-time 
  adjustments to the base scenario: \\
  (i) implementing year {\bf 2030}, \\
  (ii) implementing participation rate of {\bf 25\%}, \\ 
  (iii) implementing {\bf other types of demand profiles} for C\&I consumers.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  For interested parties, we publish an \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7180098}{online annex} 
  with a full pack of modelling results alongside this study. The annex 
  includes modelling results for all scenario combinations.

\vspace{0.1cm}
Next, we investigate how the choice of a procurement policy affects the {\bf average emissions 
rate} of 24/7 participating C\&I consumers.

\vspace{0.3cm}
Already in 2025, Ireland has a moderately clean electricity system: 
the C\&I emission rate in the reference case is at 138~kg/MWh.

\vspace{0.3cm}
100\% annual matching with renewable energy reduces the 
C\&I emission rate to 53 kg/MWh.

\vspace{0.3cm}
When actively matching the carbon-free electricity and the load with 
24/7 procurement, C\&I participants can achieve \alert{lower emission 
rates than with the 100\% RES policy} with CFE targets beyond 85\%. 
As CFE target is tightened further, average emissions \alert{drop to zero}.

  \begin{column}{6cm}
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  If we now turn to the {\bf portfolio capacity} procured by 
  C\&I consumers, we see that at this level of participation
  (10\% of C\&I load in Ireland is at 220~MW), the 100\% RES policy can be 
  me by procuring near to 1.5~GW of onshore wind and solar generators.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  In this scenario, hourly matching renewable generation and the 24/7 participating load
  requires a \alert{much bigger portfolio} of renewable generators than the 
  100\% RES policy. 

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Also, above 85\% 24/7 procurement sees \alert{battery storage} enter the portfolio  mix.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Note that for 80\% CFE, 24/7 participating C\&I consumers procure less 
  capacity than for 100\% RES policy, as it relies more on grid imports.

    It is also interesting to look at the {\bf breakdown of costs associated with
    a procurement policy} that C\&I consumers choose. 
    
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    Note that revenues from selling the excess electricity to the regional grid 
    (dark green) at market prices can be treated as "negative costs" and 
    subtracted from the net procurement cost.

    \vspace{0.3cm}
    A CFE target of 90-95\% can be achieved at a small cost premium to 100\% 
    annual renewable matching with solar, wind and batteries. However,
    what stands out in the plot is the rapid increase of procurement costs  
    for high CFE targets. For example, 98\% CFE target has 
    cost premium of only 55\% over 100\% annual renewable matching; while
    \alert{the last 2\% of hourly CFE matching more than doubles the 
    cost}.

    If we look at the results for the technological {\bf Palette 2} -- 
    when C\&I consumers have an access to the long-duration energy storage (LDES) --
    we see a different picture. The portfolio of renewable capacity 
    C\&I consumers for the 100\% CFE target is not much larger 
    than for 100\% RES (see the left panel). The LDES system helps to align the load 
    with the generation of procured variable renewable resources. 
    In the right panel, we can see that a LDES system (here 2.5~€/kWh 
    hydrogen storage in caverns) can \alert{significantly limit the procurement cost
    increase} at high CFE targets. In this scenario, 
    100\% CFE costs only 50\% more than a 100\% RES policy.

  In the next step, we explore how the 24/7 procurement affects the 
  rest of the electricity system. The plot on the left shows
  {\bf CO$_2$~emissions in the local region} of 24/7 participating 
  consumers -- Ireland.
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  Without any procurement, the model estimates 
  Irish power sector carbon emissions to be at the level of 3.5~MtCO$_2$
  (for comparison, 
  \hrefc{https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-statistics/co2/}{seai.ie}
  reports this value to be at 8.4~MtCO$_2$ in 2020, with a strong decreasing trend).

  \vspace{0.1cm}
  100\% annual renewable matching can deliver greater system-level CO$_2$ emissions
  reductions than lower CFE scores. 100\% RES reduces emissions in Ireland by 
  ca. 0.6~MtCO$_2$ per year (at 10\% participation rate).
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  However, beyond 85\% CFE targets, 24/7 hourly matching achieves
  \alert{greater emissions reductions} than 100\% RES.

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 1:} 24/7~carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement leads to 
     \alert{lower emissions for both the buyer and the system},

     {\bf Conclusion 2:} Reaching CFE for 90-95\% of the time can be done with only a \alert{small cost premium}
      compared to annually matching 100\% renewable energy. 
      90-95\% CFE can be met by supplementing wind and solar with battery storage.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 3:} Reaching 100\% CFE target is possible but costly with existing renewable 
     and storage technologies, with \alert{costs increasing rapidly above 95\%}.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 4:} 100\% CFE target could have a \alert{much smaller cost premium} if long duration storage or 
      clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 5:} 24/7~CFE procurement would create an early market for the advanced technologies,
     stimulating innovation and learning from which the \alert{whole electricity system would benefit}.

\begin{frame}{Project outlook}
  
  This project will continue analysing the impact of 24/7~CFE procurement in Europe until March 2024. \\
  In the following study, we consider deepen the analysis by examining the following:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The impacts of \alert{parametric uncertainties} and corresponding assumptions when constructing the model of 
      the European energy system. These include: \\
      \quad (i) Weather year realizations; \\
      \quad (ii) Scenarios for carbon price developments in the EU ETS; \\
      \quad (iii) Scenarios for inter-connector capacities based on the TYNDP or free optimization; \\
      \quad (iv) Scenarios for expansion of electric vehicles, heat pumps, industry electrification; \\
      \quad (v) Prices for primary energy carriers. 
      \item In addition, the modelling will use a \alert{higher-resolution grid} model,
       so that transmission network impacts can be estimated.

\section*{Annex}

\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 1/2}

  {\small

  \alert{CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the dispatch of emitting power plants 
  in the European electricity system are part of the model solution.
  We can use this information to calculate (i) the \emph{emissionality} of generation 
  that serves participating 24/7 demand, and (ii) the \emph{avoided emissions}, i.e.,
  the difference in regional CO$_2$ emissions with and without 24/7 procurement. 
  Similarly to the logic of computing the grid CFE factor, 
  we need to consider imported emissions also in this calculation.
  
  First, let $X(D)_t$ be hourly emissions $[tCO_2]$ in the rest of the electricity system. 
  The average emissions rate of the rest of the system is calculated as:

  \begin{equation*}
  SystemEmisRate = \frac{X(D)_t}{A_t + D_t}
  \end{equation*}

  Second, let $Y(E)_t$ be hourly emissions in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located.
  The emissions rate of grid supply is then:

  \begin{equation*}
  GridSupplyEmisRate = \frac{Y(E)_t + SystemEmisRate * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}
  \end{equation*}

  }
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 2/2}

  {\small
  Third, we calculate {CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the electricity consumption of 
  24/7 participating consumers on an hourly basis:
  
  \begin{equation*}
  Emissions_t = GridSupply_t * GridSupplyEmisRate_t
  \end{equation*}

  Now, we have the necessary components to calculate two metrics of interest for our analysis. 
  A first metric is the \alert{average emissions rate of 24/7 consumers}:

  \begin{equation*}
    (C\&I)EmisRate = \frac{\sum_{t\in T} Emissions_t}{\sum_{t\in T} Load_t}
  \end{equation*}

  A second metric is the \alert{avoided emissions} by 24/7 procurement. The calculation is based on the 
  difference between the total {CO$_2$ emissions} in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located
  with and without 24/7 procurement (\emph{'247-cfe'} and \emph{'reference'} labels, accordingly):

  \begin{equation*}
    AvoidedEmissions = \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{reference} - \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{247-cfe}
  \end{equation*}
  }
